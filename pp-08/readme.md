# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).
 -- Item in the photo is my Vivofit Watch

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:
The visceral level is to make rapid judgments of what is good or bad, safe or dangerous, and sends appropriate signals to the muscles (the motor system) and alerts the rest of the brain. My Vivofit- It's a devise that I can look at with ease, I have no doubt that it's not safe and I feel like the aqua color makes me look forward to wearing it, especially with my matching gym shoes.

* Behavioral: The behavioral level is the site of most human behavior, or also known as routine operations; it's something I can't go without. This device could make me want to instantly get up and start moving (doesn't mean i'll actually do it) but because the device will analyze my activity and responses with a red strip at the top when I'm being lazy, or even too lazy.

* Reflective: Reflective is known as the contemplative part of the brain. It subconsciously makes me feel better when I know I have it constantly tracking my fitness activity as well as my sleep activity. I know I can also reflect on the overall data it provides me at any time I want, when syncing it to my phone.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. The watch (to me) is aesthetically pleasing. Aesthetics is important for a website. It shouldn't have too much, but enough to set a mood or impression to the user.
2. The watch is simple to use, just one button that takes care of 7 different tasks. I think our site should also have a minimal and simple design.
3. The watch does what it promises to do, and we need to make sure our site does exactly what it's supposed to do and reflects confidence.
