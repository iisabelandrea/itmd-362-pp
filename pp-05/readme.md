## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53v090ke1sO4UUr7iIt00++o1eB
Your Rationale: For some reason whenever I think of 'new' technology, I think of colors similar to these such as white and blues. These colors are usually used for more clean and crisp looks.
2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=51h1a0koHtefkSdjVBGsVn5AIf5
Your Rationale: I chose more vibrant colors for this one because I feel like Botanical Gardens are full of vibrant colors as they're well kept up and maintained.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53X1a1k9Fqb3uYf4NDVezkElaf9k7eDZ1N+F4rTnd6sgkFkmkkACK8XYZfhPJpKuQtOmj
Your Rationale: I'm sort of using the colors from WhatApp but I think the magenta adds a nice touch to it, maybe for alerts or pings.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000a0klFnieLMBhDutrdhbD98D
Your Rationale: Initially I wanted to go with a more deeper and darker color of red but when I looked at site examples, it almost felt eye-straining with all of the dark reds. So with that I decided to go for a lighter base color red, and darker 'rubier' colors around the palette.
