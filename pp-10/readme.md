# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

Website: shpeillinois.tech

I chose the website shpeillinois.tech to redesign. It is the website for the student organization that I am
a part of, and the site consists of information including purpose, mission, goals, contact information,
as well as events, and resources listed for students.

I'll begin with the welcome page. When you enter the website, out comes this giant slide show that has photos
from various events hosted by our organization.. It's nice, but it takes up the entire screen and I remember
when I first visited the site, I wasn't sure where else to look next.

So my first idea was to get rid of that slideshow, and to have our most professional group photo aligned to the right side of the page,
and the information about SHPE, and SHPE IIT. -- Doing this will tell the users what it really is about, and it'll focus
more on the purpose of the org.

I would also like to completely get rid of the "About" Tab, and have the following tabs above such as
HOME: To take users back to the main page when navigating else where,
Gallery: This is where I imagine more of an Instagram type of layout to display all the photos and captions,
EVENTS: To highlight the past (only if it was a major event) and upcoming events,
CONTACT US: Where we can have an embedded form (Getting rid of google form that is there) for user to fill out
if they have an questions. We can also list our Sign Up option there, as well as other resourceful links that might be helpful.


Lastly, as they scroll down while on the main page they'll have more options to read our constitution, learn more
about their current executive board members, and learn more about our SHPE JR (HighSchool) chapter, along with
one more tab about SHPE National.

As far as code modification, I would start from scratch and not use a site like HTML 5 UP to design the page.
Building the site from scratch would make our site more authentic and we could be more flexible with the design.
Also we can have more fun with our JS. I noticed when you load the site, it takes a quick second before the content
pops up. As far as the CSS is concerned, I would add media queries in the CSS so that it's responsive when using
a mobile or ipad device.

I'm sure there are even better ways to redesign our site, but this will be just start, and I really hope that I
can work with the next Webmaster in the upcoming 2017-2018 Academic year to pitch these ideas, and work together at it.
